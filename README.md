Aptcoder Front-End Developer Job Assessment Report: 
Creating ToDo List in Vue.js

In response to the Front-End Developer job assessment, I have developed a simple responsive  ToDo List application using Vue.js. The ToDo List is designed to allow users to manage their tasks effectively, providing features such as updating tasks by removing tasks, marking and viewing completed tasks, viewing open tasks, displaying title, details, creation dates, due date  and auto-saving user data for retrieval upon reopening the tab.



Features Implemented:

 A check-off list of everything that has been done.
 All open tasks are shown in a list for easy viewing by the user.
The date of creation is visible to the user.
The userâ€™s list of tasks will be saved when the tab is closed and retrieved later.

Vue.js Framework:
The application is built using the Vue.js framework, leveraging its reactive and component-based architecture for efficient development and seamless user interactions.
Json Server:
To implement auto-saving functionality, the application utilizes the Json API to store user data on server in json format. This ensures that the user's tasks persist even after the tab is closed or the browser is refreshed.
Styling:
The application's UI is styled using TailwindCSS to provide a clean and intuitive user experience. Responsive design principles are applied to ensure optimal usability across various devices and screen sizes.
